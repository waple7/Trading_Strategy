**A major drawback of cryptocurrency trading is the volatility of the market.** 

The currency trades can occur 24/7, and tracking crypto positions can be an impossible task to manage without automation. Automated Machine Learning trading algorithms can assist in managing this task to predict the market's movement. We can use models to classify future movements into three categories:

1. **The market will rise** (take a long position)
2. **The market will fall** (take a short position)
3. **The market will move sideways** (take no position)

The problem of predicting a buy (value = 1) or sell (value = 0) signal for a trading strategy is defined within the classification framework.

### Importance of Data Harvesting and Feature Engineering

Data harvesting (data collection in this context) and feature engineering are relevant factors in improving time series models. It's interesting to investigate whether traditionally stock-oriented feature engineering modifications are relevant to digital assets, and if so, which ones.
